Crafting clean, modern, intentional mobile experiences.

## **Introduction**

I’m Ashutosh, a React Native developer who values clarity, minimalism and meaningful interaction design.  
I build mobile experiences that feel **smooth**, **intentional**, and **pleasant to use**.

My design philosophy leans toward:

- Calm and structured UI  
- Subtle but expressive motion  
- Clean typography  
- Pixel-level attention  
- Efficiency in both performance and code architecture  

---

## **What I Do**

- Build modern **React Native** applications  
- Create UI systems with consistent spacing & layout rules  
- Implement clean modular architecture  
- Optimize for performance & responsiveness  
- Integrate thoughtful motion (Reanimated, Layout Animations)  
- Design interfaces inspired by iOS clarity & elegance  

## **Tech I Work With**

**Core**
- React Native  
- TypeScript  
- React Navigation  
- Zustand / Jotai / Context patterns  

**Motion**
- Reanimated  
- Gesture Handler  
- Layout Animations  

**Ecosystem**
- Node.js  
- Linux (Arch)  
- Git  
- Android Studio (only because required)  

---

## **Workflow Principles**

1. **Minimal first. Beautiful after.**  
2. **Spacing > decoration.**  
3. **Animation should feel natural, not dramatic.**  
4. **Architecture should decrease complexity, not hide it.**  
5. **Dark mode is not a theme. It’s a lifestyle.**  
6. **Every pixel should have a reason.**

## **Current Focus**

- Improving animation fluency in React Native  
- Designing more structured UI systems  
- Creating subtle, expressive motion patterns  
- Writing cleaner, more maintainable TypeScript  
- Building applications that feel light, calm, and fluid

## **Working Environment**

- Arch Linux (because control > convenience)  
- VSCode with minimal extensions  
- Terminal-first workflow  
- Focus mode habits: calm music, low brightness, structured time blocks
