### 🌿 **Introduction**

I’m Ashutosh, a React Native developer who values **clarity**, **minimalism**, and **meaningful interaction design**.  
I build mobile experiences that feel **smooth**, **intentional**, and **pleasant to use**.

My design philosophy leans toward:
- Calm and structured UI  
- Subtle but expressive motion  
- Clean typography  
- Pixel-level attention  
- Efficiency in both performance and code architecture  

---

### 🕉️ Life Philosophy ###

- Act with purpose, detach from outcome.
- Equanimity in success and failure.
- Clarity arises when the mind is still.  
- Do your duty—skillfully, selflessly, fully.  
- The wise work not for reward, but for harmony.  

### 🛠️ **What I Do**

- Build modern **React Native** applications  
- Create UI systems with consistent spacing & layout rules  
- Implement clean modular architecture  
- Optimize for performance & responsiveness  
- Integrate thoughtful motion (Reanimated, Layout Animations)  
- Design interfaces inspired by iOS clarity & elegance

### 📜 **Workflow Principles**

1. **Minimal first. Beautiful after.**  
2. **Spacing > decoration.**  
3. **Animation should feel natural, not dramatic.**  
4. **Architecture should decrease complexity, not hide it.**  
5. **Dark mode is not a theme. It’s a lifestyle.**  
6. **Every pixel should have a reason.**

### 🔍 **Current Focus**

- Improving animation fluency in React Native  
- Designing more structured UI systems  
- Creating subtle, expressive motion patterns  
- Writing cleaner, more maintainable TypeScript  
- Building applications that feel light, calm, and fluid  

---

### 🖥️ **Working Environment**

- **Arch Linux** (because control > convenience)  
- **VSCode** with minimal extensions  
- Terminal-first workflow  
- Focus mode habits: calm music, low brightness, structured time blocks
